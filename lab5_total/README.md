These are my thoughts on using the debugger:
- I thought the debugger was useful about half the time?
- There were scenarios where it was very helpful in showing where the segmentation error occurred
- but also times where the code ran, but didn't return the right output, and hte debugger didnt help very much then
- just returned som assembly-like code, and I just used a bunch of print statements then.
